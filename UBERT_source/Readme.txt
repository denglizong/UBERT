1) To prepare the environment install the latest version of CONDA and run ubert.sh
2) Update the language_modelling.py in Transformer (HuggingFace), with language_modelling.py in environment folder
3) For each of the experiments the training and testing scripts are the same. E.g., when training/testing with BLUEBERT, the BLUEBERT model needs to be loaded.
